# MScFE Capstone Group 9192

Welcome to the official repository for the MSc Financial Engineering Capstone Project by Group 9192.

## 📘 Project Overview

This capstone project:

Asset allocation and machine (deep) learning: A performance analysis of energy industry within distressed market conditions

In This project:
LSTM and GBR models are applied to daily historical price data of U.S. energy sector stocks with intraday prices greater than $50.
Minimize losses from distressed market periods.
Assess the performance of deep learning-based allocations versus traditional mean-variance allocation subject to monthly rebalancing.
Evaluate  the performance of the model, measure with metrics like maximum drawdown, Sortino ratio, the Sharpe ratio, and portfolio turnover.


Currently under development.
